SettlUp was born out of necessity - initially written just for my fianc√©e and I to split bills and other expenses, there never seemed to be a good way to keep track of it all. Originally called "Split-the-diff", it was developed as a front-end-only app that was more calculator-like, and more than a little uglier. Once I started re-writing my original app RedwoodJS seemed like the perfect choice because of its excellent database support, powered by Prisma - not to mention the tight integration with some of my favorite hosting providers, CSS utilities, and a built-in, self-hosted authentication system.

Currently, users can sign up, create a "tab" for two people, and enter in multiple expenses for both parties. Once entered, the SettlUp will let you know who owes whom what to make things even. Ever a work in progress, I intend to make it so that users invite other users to a tab, only enter their own expenses, approve requests to settle and integrate with some form of money sending (originally I wanted to use Venmo but looks like they closed their API some time ago). If you are interested in running SettlUp yourself and need some help getting it set up, please let me know!
