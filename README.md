# SettlUp

SettleUp is a tool designed to make splitting shared expenses quick and painless.

Create an account on [SettlUp.app](https://settlup.app) to get started!

Currently, users can sign up, create a tab for two people, and enter in multiple expenses for both parties. Once entered, the SettlUp will let you know who owes whom what to make things even. Press the "Mark as Settled" button mark all unsettled expenses on a tab as settled. Once settled, expeses can not be deleted and are not used to calculate totals going forward. If you are interested in running SettlUp yourself and need some help getting it set up, please let me know! You can find me on twitter at [@mmarino92](https://twitter.com/mmarino92) or in the [RedwoodJS Discord](http://discord.gg/redwoodjs).
